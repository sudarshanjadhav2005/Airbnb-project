## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of regulations on the Airbnb market in Paris, focusing on how host participation, pricing, and locality-level dynamics evolved over time. Using listing and review datasets from Airbnb, the study explores trends in affordability, distribution of prices across neighborhoods, and how policy interventions reshaped supply and demand.


## Key Objectives
Assess Airbnb supply and host participation trends in Paris.
Evaluate the impact of regulation on new host entries and listing activity.
Explore pricing dynamics, including distribution, affordability, and shifts over time.
Compare neighbourhood-level average prices to understand premium vs. budget areas.
Generate business insights for hosts, customers, and policymakers.

## Quick Summary of Findings
Strong growth pre-2017: Rapid expansion of listings with competitive pricing.
Regulation slowdown (2017 onward): Noticeable dip in new host entries, with supply growth stabilizing.
Demand resilience: Despite supply restrictions, customer demand and occupancy remained steady.
Pricing patterns: Competition pre-2017 kept prices moderate; post-regulation, supply constraints drove price increases in popular neighbourhoods.
Locality insights: Central Paris remains premium, while outer arrondissements attract budget-conscious travelers.

## Tech Stack
Python (pandas, numpy): Data cleaning & processing
Matplotlib / Seaborn: Data visualization
Scipy / Statsmodels (optional): Statistical analysis
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive analysis

## Reproducibility & Notes
All analysis is contained in the Jupyter notebook airbnb-impact-of-regulation.ipynb.
The environment requires Python 3.8+ with packages listed in requirements.txt.
Random seeds (where applicable) are set for reproducibility of sampling or statistical checks.
The datasets used come from publicly available Airbnb data snapshots on Kaggle / Inside Airbnb. Ensure you have the same raw snapshot for consistent results.

## Future Work
Extend the study to cross-city comparisons (e.g., Paris vs. Berlin, Amsterdam, London).
Add time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict pricing and demand.
Build an interactive dashboard (Plotly Dash, Power BI, or Tableau) for stakeholders.
Incorporate geospatial analysis with geopandas to visualize neighbourhood trends in detail.
Run counterfactual simulations to estimate market behaviour without regulation.
